## Changing Colors

### Understanding the Color System

The website uses a brown/wood-inspired color palette. Colors are defined in Tailwind CSS format.

**File to edit:** `tailwind.config.js`

### Main Color Palette

The colors are in the `primary` section (around line 10):

```javascript
primary: {
  50: '#faf8f5',   // Lightest - backgrounds
  100: '#f5f0e8',  // Very light
  200: '#e8dcc5',  // Light
  300: '#d4bc92',  // Light-medium
  400: '#c19a5f',  // Medium
  500: '#a87c3f',  // Main brand color
  600: '#8b6534',  // Darker - buttons
  700: '#6e4e2a',  // Dark
  800: '#523a1f',  // Very dark
  900: '#362615',  // Darkest - headings
},
```

### To Change the Main Brown Color

1. Open `tailwind.config.js`
2. Find `primary-600: '#8b6534'` (this is the main button color)
3. Replace with your preferred color code
4. You can use a color picker tool online to get color codes

**Helpful tool:** https://colorhunt.co/ for color palette ideas

### Quick Color Changes

To make the website less brown and more (for example) blue:

1. Change `primary-600` to a blue color like `#3b82f6`
2. Adjust other shades accordingly
3. Save and reload to see changes

**Note:** Keep the structure (50-900 shades) but change the colors themselves.

},
```

3. Save the file
