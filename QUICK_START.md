# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide - OAKTIMBER Website

Get your website up and running in 5 minutes!

## Step 1: Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

Open your terminal in this folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This downloads all the necessary packages. You'll see a progress bar - wait for it to complete.

**What this does:** Installs React, Tailwind CSS, and other tools needed to run the website.

---

## Step 2: Start the Development Server (30 seconds)

Run this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**What happens next:**
- Your default browser will open automatically
- You'll see the OAKTIMBER website
- The address will be: `http://localhost:3000`

**Keep this terminal window open!** The website runs as long as this is running.

---

## Step 3: View Your Website

The website should open automatically, but if not:

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: `http://localhost:3000`
3. Click around and explore!

**Pages to check:**
- Home (landing page)
- About (company story)
- Products & Services (what you offer)
- Gallery (portfolio showcase)
- Contact (contact form)

## Step 4: Make Your First Edit (1 minute)

Let's change the main headline on the home page:

1. Open this file in your editor: `src/pages/Home.jsx`
2. Find line 50 (look for "Crafting Timeless")
3. Change the text to anything you want
4. **Save the file** (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
5. Look at your browser - it updates automatically! âœ¨

**Magic!** The dev server auto-reloads when you save changes.

## Step 5: Add Your First Image (2 minutes)

1. Find a photo of your work
2. Copy it to: `public/images/`
3. Name it something simple like: `hero.jpg`

Now let's use it:

4. Open `src/pages/Home.jsx`
5. Find the hero image section (around line 85)
6. Replace the placeholder with your image path
7. Save and check your browser!
